This repository contains the source code for the improved [ESIM](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/esim.html) event camera simulator used in **Great*e*-NeRF** 
<sub>[![Project Page](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project_Page-black
)]() [![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-black)]() [![Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Code-black)]() [![Dataset](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dataset-black)]()</sub>.
In particular, we incorporate the following changes:

1. Event simulation model
   - Improve the overall event simulation accuracy by accounting for additional edge cases 
   - Improve the refractory period model by explicitly resetting the pixel reference intensity and timestamp at the end of the refractory period
   - Desynchronize initial event generation across pixels by randomly initializing pixel reference timestamps
   - Model junction leakage, which increases the rate of ON events and decreases the rate of OFF events
   - Modify the pixel-to-pixel contrast threshold variation model to be time-independent
   - Merge `feature/color` branch to support color event cameras
2. Rendering engine
   - Support [Blender](https://www.blender.org) as a rendering engine specially for blender 4.0 above.
3. Camera trajectory
   - Circumvent singularities in interpolating quaternion orientations by supporting rotation vector/angle-axis orientation representation in the trajectory CSV for interpolation
4. Miscellaneous
   - Fix various bugs & installation errors

## Installation
The following installation steps were tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 with GTX4060Ti 16GB , GTX 4090, RTX 3090 and RTX A6000 GPUs.

### ROS Installation
We highly recommend you to install according to the [ROS Wiki](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation),and here is a one-click concise Chinese method if you don't want to spend much time in it.
```bash
 wget http://fishros.com/install -O fishros && . fishros
```
This is a powerful tool that supports:

- One-click installation: ROS (supports ROS and ROS2, Raspberry Pi Jetson), VsCode (supports amd64 and arm64), github desktop version, nodejs development environment

- One-click configuration: rosdep (fast and easy to use), ROS environment (quickly update ROS environment settings, automatically generate environment selection), system source (change system source, support full version of Ubuntu system), Docker (support amd64 and arm64), cartographer, WeChat client

### ESIM

We recommend creating a new Catkin workspace specifically for ESIM. We name the workspace as `esim_ws` and place it under the home directory, as follows :
```bash
mkdir -p ~/esim_ws/src
```

Clone this repository into the source space of the workspace with:
```bash
cd ~/esim_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/SuperFCR/rpg_esim.git
```

We also recommend using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to set up an environment with the appropriate dependencies for running ESIM, as follows:
1. Install [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), an improved re-implementation of Conda, according to the [official instructions](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mamba-installation.html#mamba-install)
2. Create the `esim` environment with:
   ```bash
   mamba env create -f rpg_esim/environment.yml
   ```
3. Activate the environment and initialize `rosdep` with:
   ```bash
   conda activate esim
   rosdep init
   rosdep update
   ```
   
Initialize and configure the workspace with:
```bash
catkin init
catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
vcs-import < rpg_esim/dependencies.yaml

cd ze_oss
touch imp_3rdparty_cuda_toolkit/CATKIN_IGNORE \
      imp_app_pangolin_example/CATKIN_IGNORE \
      imp_benchmark_aligned_allocator/CATKIN_IGNORE \
      imp_bridge_pangolin/CATKIN_IGNORE \
      imp_cu_core/CATKIN_IGNORE \
      imp_cu_correspondence/CATKIN_IGNORE \
      imp_cu_imgproc/CATKIN_IGNORE \
      imp_ros_rof_denoising/CATKIN_IGNORE \
      imp_tools_cmd/CATKIN_IGNORE \
      ze_data_provider/CATKIN_IGNORE \
      ze_geometry/CATKIN_IGNORE \
      ze_imu/CATKIN_IGNORE \
      ze_trajectory_analysis/CATKIN_IGNORE
```
We set `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`, instead of `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`, to preserve the ease of debugging while still enabling code optimization during compilation.

Build the `esim_ros` package with:
```bash
catkin build esim_ros
```

Lastly, add the following alias to your `.bashrc` file for activating the `esim` Conda environment and sourcing the [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) environment setup files:
```bash
alias cae='conda activate esim; source ~/esim_ws/devel/setup.bash'
```

The installation steps described above were consolidated from the following sources, with some modifications:

### Blender

To use Blender as the rendering engine, we require [Blender as a Python module](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_advanced_blender_as_bpy.html) being installed in a separate `blender` Conda environment with a compatible Python version and [PyZMQ](https://pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) also installed.

We provide a Python wheel for Blender 4.0.3 at [this link](https://github.com/wengflow/rpg_esim/releases/download/Released_v1.0/bpy-4.0.0-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl), which is compiled with [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) 11.3 and [NVIDIA OptiX](https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/ray-tracing/optix) 7.3.0 support (requires NVIDIA R465.84 driver or newer), for Linux and Python 3.10. The `blender` environment may be created with all the necessary dependencies, including this wheel, with the following:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f rpg_esim/blender_environment_4_0.yml
   ```

Alternatively, build Blender as a Python module from source, according to the [official instructions](https://wiki.blender.org/w/index.php?title=Building_Blender/Other/BlenderAsPyModule), and install it via `pip` in the `blender` environment.

## Using Blender as the Rendering Engine

### Configuration Options
Configuration options for the Blender rendering engine are detailed at the top of `blender_renderer.cpp` of the `imp_blender_renderer` ROS package. Note that with N GPUs, the valid `blender_render_device_type` and `blender_render_device_id` combinations are as follows:

| `blender_render_device_type` | `blender_render_device_id` |
| :---: | :---: |
| 0 (CPU) | N |
| 1 (CUDA) | 0 to N-1 |
| 2 (OptiX) | N+1 to 2N |

A sample usage is provided in `cfg/blender.conf` of the `esim_ros` package.

### Running ESIM with Blender

First, start the Blender rendering server on a given port (*e.g.* 5555) with:
```bash
cae
roscd imp_blender_renderer
conda activate blender_4_0
python scripts/blender_bridge.py --port 5555
```

Then, run ESIM under a given configuration (*e.g.* `cfg/blender.conf`) in another terminal with:
```bash
cae
roscd esim_ros
roslaunch esim_ros esim.launch config:=cfg/blender.conf
```

To visualize the output of the simulator, you can open `rviz` (from a new terminal) as follows:
```bash
cae
roscd esim_visualization
rviz -d cfg/esim.rviz
```

You can also open `rqt` for more visualizations, as follows:
```bash
cae
roscd esim_visualization
rqt --perspective-file cfg/esim.perspective
```

Please refer to the [ESIM wiki](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_esim/wiki) for further details on the usage of other rendering engines.
